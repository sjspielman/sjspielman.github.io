I have been involved in teaching and designing a wide variety of courses. As a TA, I have taught Evolutionary Biology (both at UT Austin and Brown University), Biostatistics, and Computational Biology. I played an integral role in designing the curricula and course materials, including computer lab exercises (mostly in R and Python) and video tutorials, for the latter two courses.

Through UT Austin's [Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/) (CCBB), I have been involved in multiple initiatives to teach biological computing and introductory programming to students of all levels (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral). Below are links to the websites for courses I have designed and taught.
