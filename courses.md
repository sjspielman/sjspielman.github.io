I have been involved in teaching and designing a wide variety of courses. As a TA, I have taught Evolutionary Biology (both at UT Austin and Brown University), Biostatistics, and Computational Biology. Furthermore, during the summer of 2011, I worked for UT Austin's Statistics and Data Sciences department (then the Statistics and Scientific Computing division) to re-design the undergraduate Biostatistics curriculum. In this capacity, I developed computer lab exerises and video tutorials for basic biostatistics analysis, ranging from summary statistics to multivariate linear modeling, in R.

Through UT Austin's [Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/) (CCBB), I have been involved in multiple initiatives to teach biological computing and introductory programming to students of all levels (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral). Below are links to the websites for courses I have designed and taught.
