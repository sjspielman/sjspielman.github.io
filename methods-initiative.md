title: Software and Computational Methods in Biology

Thank you for your interest in sharing your favorite open-source scientific software and computational methods! You are doing a great service assisting your fellow scientists make informed decisions about how to best conduct their research. **The goal is to create a living document with information about actively-used computational methods and software in biology.** 


[Follow this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14rl5_ATefEJ2Vc9ArWvDdIsdlsbH1uVmMNISWL-E6fI/edit#gid=0) to a Google Spreadsheet where we are currently collecting information about methods/software platforms. Each sheet within corresponds to a different primary scientific field:

+ Evolution
+ Ecology
+ NextGen sequencing/analysis
+ Data analysis and/or biostatistics
+ Unsure
    
Feel free to email me at `stephanie.spielman@gmail.com` to request a new page for a currently unconsidered scientific field. If you are unsure to which primary field your submitted method belongs, please add to the *Unsure* sheet, and I will assess its placement. As participation grows, separate Google spreadsheets will be created per field, with sub-sheets within for subfields. The small list you see now is simply a starting point!

Please fill out the following fields when submitting your method. Note that two types of methods are accepted: standalone software and language-specific libraries/packages. Columns A/B should be used for software packages, and columns C/D should be used for libraries. *Please only fill out* **A/B** *or* **C/D** (note, there may be some exceptions, for example packages within Bioconductor, which itself is an R package). 

Before you add a new row to the list, please to a quick `ctl+F` search to see if it's already there. If so, head to column **H** (see below). 

+ **A**: The name of the method/software you are using. Note: if the method is distributed in a larger suite of methods (e.g. the "codeml" method in PAML) or as a single method in a software platform, please indicate the specific method (codeml) in column A, and the “parent platform” (PAML) in B. <br><br>
+ **B**: A parent platform that distributes the method/software in column (A). Leave this column blank if not applicable. <br><br>
+ **C**: The name of the package/library, for example the "dplyr" R package.<br><br>
+ **D**: The language for the package specified in column *C*, for example "R" or "python".<br><br>
+ **E**: A reference for your provided method. Please provide, if possible, a link or doi to relevant publication/pre-print. If not applicable (many data analysis packages will fall into this category), you can leave blank.<br><br>
+ **F**: The year the method was released. This information will help to find the most recent methods for a given application. If the method/software is being actively maintained, please provide the most recent version (for ease, this can correspond to the year the most recent paper was published).<br><br>
+ **G**: A website corresponding to this method. This website should contain the source code, a distributed software build, user manual, etc. **At a minimum, the provided link must allow users to download or explain how to obtain the method. Unaccessible/unobtainable methods cannot be considered in this spreadsheet.** Note that CRAN, PyPi, CPAN, etc. links are acceptable here.<br><br>
+ **H**: Scientific sub-fields for your method. For example, the software "RAxML", which reconstructs phylogenies using maximum likelihood, could have the following subfields: phylogenetics, molecular evolution, etc. Please separate multiple subfields by commas or semi-colons.<br><br>
+ **I**: A brief description of this software/method, what it does, and/or why it's useful. For example, the description for RAxML would be "build phylogenies with maximum likelihood," or similar. **If your method already appears in the spreadsheet, consider adding to and/or improving the description in this field!**
