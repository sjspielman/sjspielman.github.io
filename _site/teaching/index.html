<p>I am deeply passionate about undergraduate (and beyond!) education, and I have been involved in teaching and designing a wide variety of courses. As a TA, I have taught Evolutionary Biology (both at UT Austin and Brown University), Biostatistics, and Computational Biology. Furthermore, during the summer of 2011, I worked for UT Austin’s Statistics and Data Sciences department (then the Statistics and Scientific Computing division) to re-design the undergraduate Biostatistics curriculum. In this capacity, I developed computer lab exerises and video tutorials for basic biostatistics analysis, ranging from summary statistics to multivariate linear modeling, in R.</p>

<p>Through UT Austin’s <a href="ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/">Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</a> (CCBB), I have been involved in multiple initiatives to teach biological computing and introductory programming to students of all levels (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral). In particular, during the spring semester, I run, along with my co-instructor <a href="http://www.rebeccatarvin.com/">Rebecca Tarvin</a>, a peer-led working group on Biological Computing. Materials from our Spring 2015 group are freely available from <a href="http://sjspielman.org/UTbiocomputing2015">http://sjspielman.org/UTbiocomputing2015</a>.</p>

<p>During May 2015, I was the lead instructor for CCBB’s Introduction to Python course, as part of the Big Data in Biology Summer School. All course materials (which I designed) are freely available from <a href="http://sjspielman.org/ccbb_bigdata2015_python">http://sjspielman.org/ccbb_bigdata2015_python</a>.</p>
