In my current position at Temple University, I am an active developer contributing to the software package [HyPhy](http://hyphy.org) ("**Hy**pothesis testing with **Phy**logenies), which contains a wide variety of approaches and features a customizable batch language for studying evolutionary dynamics in genetic/genomic data.

Software packages I have developed separately include the following:

+ [Pyvolve]({{ base.url }}/pyvolve), a python platform to simulate sequences along a phylogeny using continuous-time Markov models.

+ [alignfigR]({{ base.url }}/alignfigR), an R package to create multiple sequence alignment figures.

+ [phyphy](https://github.com/sjspielman/phyphy), [**In development**] a python library for faciliating and parsing [HyPhy](http://hyphy.org) batch analyses
