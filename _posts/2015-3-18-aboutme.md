I am a 4th year PhD Candidate in [Claus Wilke's lab](https://wilkelab.org) through the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/graduate/eeb/) at UT Austin.
My CV (last updated 3/18/15) is available [here](./files/CV_SJSpielman.pdf), and my research interests broadly encompass computational molecular evolution, protein evolution, and phylogenetics.
