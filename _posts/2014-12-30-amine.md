Biogenic amine receptors play critical roles in regulating behavior and physiology, particularly within the central nervous system, in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Members of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, these receptors interact with endogenous bioamine ligands, such as dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine, and they are targeted by a wide array of pharmaceuticals. Despite these receptors' clear clinical and biological importance, their evolutionary history remains poorly characterized. In particular, the relationships among biogenic amine receptors and any specific evolutionary constraints acting within distinct receptor subtypes, or indeed overarching trends governing biogenic amine receptor evolution as a whole, are largely unknown. 
Broadly, I am working to characterize the evolutionary dynamics within this receptor family. To begin, I developed an iterative strategy merging traditional progressive sequence alignment with robust structural predictions to generate a comprehensive structurally-informed multiple sequence alignment, and corresponding structurally-partitioned phylogeny, which broadly spans vertebrate lineages and includes all biogenic amine receptor subtypes (available [here](https://github.com/sjspielman/amine_receptors)). Together, these resources will enable more in-depth and rigorous analyses into the molecular evolution of this receptor family.
