# About Me


I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in [Claus Wilke's lab](http://wilkelab.org) through the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior graduate program](http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/graduate/eeb/) at UT Austin.
My CV (updated 11/25/15) is available for download [here](../files/CV_SJSpielman.pdf), and my research interests broadly encompass computational molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and protein evolution. 
My current research focuses on the relationships among different statistical models of coding-sequence evolution.
