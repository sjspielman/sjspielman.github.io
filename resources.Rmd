# Resources


This page contains (mostly) third-party resources you can use to learn computing for data science and bioinformatics, focusing on open source and reproducible approaches. These resources include online short courses, workshops, blog posts, and books (some \$\$) that I've found over the years which seem useful for others. 

_Do you have or know of a resource you think I should include?_ Let me know with an issue [here](https://github.com/sjspielman/sjspielman.github.io/issues)!
