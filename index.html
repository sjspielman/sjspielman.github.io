I am a Research Assisant Professor in the Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine</a> at Temple University, in Dr. Sergei Kosakovsky Pond's lab. I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/graduate/eeb/"> Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior graduate program</a> at UT Austin, through <a href="http://wilkelab.org"> Claus Wilke's lab</a>. My research interests broadly encompass computational molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and protein evolution.
