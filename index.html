<p>
I am a Research Assisant Professor in the <a href="http://igem.temple.edu"> Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine</a> at <a href="https://www.temple.edu"> Temple University </a>, in Sergei L. Kosakovsky Pond's lab. I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/graduate/eeb/"> Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior graduate program</a> at UT Austin, through <a href="http://wilkelab.org"> Claus Wilke's lab</a>. My research interests broadly encompass computational molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and comparative genomics. In addition to research, I have a strong interest in teaching and undergraduate education.
