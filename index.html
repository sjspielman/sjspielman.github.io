{% include image.html url="/images/me.png" width=145 align="left" %}

<p>
I recently obtained my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/graduate/eeb/"> Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior graduate program</a> at UT Austin, through <a href="http://wilkelab.org"> Claus Wilke's lab</a>. In August 2016, I will be joining the
<a href="http://igem.temple.edu/"> Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine</a> at Temple University as a Research Assistant Professor in Dr. Sergei Kosakovsky Pond's lab. My research interests broadly encompass computational molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and protein evolution.
