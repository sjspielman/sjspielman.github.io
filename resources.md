This page contains various materials (updated regularly) of useful links and resources for students and researchers to learn and master various topics.

First and foremost, I strongly recommend that anyone starting out in bioinformatics invest in the wonderful book [*Practical Computing for Biologists*](http://practicalcomputing.org/). 

### Lessons and Exercises

+ [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) contains lots of free course materials and practice problems for learning R, git, Python, and UNIX.
+ [My course page](http://sjspielman.org/courses/) contains links to previous courses (including short courses) on Python programming/computing, UNIX, biostatistics, and more. Explore!

### Python

+ [An Introduction to Programming for Bioscientists: A Python-Based Primer](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004867)

### 10 Simple Rules

The PLOS journals have a series of papers on ["10 simple rules"](http://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules) to help navigate various topics, including scientific writing, programming skills, job applications, and general advice in various research components.

### R and the *tidyverse*
